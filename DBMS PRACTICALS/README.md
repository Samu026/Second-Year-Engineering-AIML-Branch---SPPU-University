**Suggested List of Laboratory Assignments (Software - MySql Workbench)**

**Group A: Study of Databases** 

Mapping of Course Outcomes Group A -- CO1 
1.  Study of MySQL Open source software. Discuss the characteristics like efficiency, scalability, 
performance and transactional properties 
2. Install and configure client and server of MySQL.(Show all commands and necessary steps for 
installation and configuration) 
3. Study of SQLite: What is SQLite? Uses of Sqlite. Building and installing SQLite.
    
**Group B: MySQL** 

Mapping of Course Outcomes Group B -- CO2, CO3, CO4, CO5 
1.  Design any database with at least 3 entities and relationships between them. Draw suitable 
ER/EER diagram for the system. 
2. Design and implement a database (for assignment no 1) using DDL statements and apply 
normalization on them 
3.  Create Table with primary key and foreign key constraints. 
a. Alter table with add n modify   b. Drop table   
4.  Perform following SQL queries on the database created in assignment 1. 
• Implementation of relational operators in SQL 
• Boolean operators and pattern matching 
• Arithmetic operations and built in functions 
• Group functions 
• Processing Date and Time functions 
• Complex queries and set operators 
5.  Execute DDL/DML statements which demonstrate the use of views. Update the base table using 
its corresponding view. Also consider restrictions on updatable views and perform view 
creation from multiple tables.

**Group C: PL/SQL** 

Mapping of Course Outcomes Group C -- CO6 
1. Write and execute PL/SQL stored procedure and function to perform a suitable task on the  
    database. Demonstrate its use. 
2. Write and execute suitable database triggers .Consider row level and statement level triggers. 
3. Write a PL/SQL block to implement all types of cursor.
   
**Group D:  Relational Database Design**

Mapping of Course Outcomes Group D -- CO5, CO6 
Design and case study of any organization (back end only), Project Proposal and High Level SRS 
To prepare for project, do the following: 
1. Form teams of around 3 to 4 people  
2. Create requirements document with the following information:- 
a. Give one or two paragraph description of your goals for the topic(s).  
b. List what all types of users will be accessing your application 
c. List the various functionalities that your application will support. Explain each in about a 
paragraph worth of detail. 
d. List the hardware and software requirements at the backend and at the front end.  
e. Give an estimate of the number of users of each type, the expected load (transactions per 
day), and the expected database size.

**Project ER Diagram and Database Design**

For ER diagram and Database design following guidelines can be used: 
1. Draw an ER diagram of your project. 
2. Reduce this ER diagram into the tables and complete database design.  
3. Subsequently, list all the functional dependencies on each table that you expect will hold. 
4. Check that the database schema is in 3NF/BCNF. If it is not, apply normalization. Use non
loss decomposition and bring the database schema in 3NF/BCNF. 
Give the ER diagram and the data dictionary as part of the requirement specifications file which 
you created for the project proposal.
